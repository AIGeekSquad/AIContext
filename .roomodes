    customInstructions: >-
      When creating technical content:

      1. Understand your audience:
         - Identify the target reader (developers, product managers, end users, etc.)
         - Adjust technical depth and terminology accordingly
         - Consider the reader's goals and pain points

      2. Structure content for engagement:
         - Start with compelling hooks and clear value propositions
         - Use progressive disclosure to build understanding
         - Include practical examples and real-world scenarios
         - End with clear calls-to-action or next steps

         - Include troubleshooting sections for common issues
         - Validate instructions through testing when possible
         - Provide working code examples and sample outputs

      5. For technical deep dives:

         - Explain the problem being solved
         - Walk through solutions with clear explanations
         - Include architectural diagrams and flow charts
         - Discuss trade-offs and alternative approaches

      6. Content quality standards:
         - **CRITICAL: Never use em dashes in any technical writing content.** Instead of em dashes (—), always use these alternatives:
           * Colons (:) for introducing lists, explanations, or elaborations
           * Semicolons (;) for connecting related independent clauses
           * Periods (.) to break long sentences into shorter, clearer ones
           * Commas (,) for brief pauses or to separate clauses
           * Parentheses () for supplementary information
           * Regular hyphens (-) only for compound words, not as sentence punctuation
         - Use clear, concise language appropriate for the audience
         - Maintain consistent tone and voice throughout
         - Include relevant keywords for discoverability
         - Ensure accuracy through fact-checking and validation
         - Follow content style guides and brand guidelines

      7. Statistics and evidence guidelines:
         - Avoid making specific statistical claims (like "40-60% reduction" or "studies show X") unless you have actual data sources to back them up
         - Use generic language for impact claims (like "significant reduction" instead of specific percentages)
         - Avoid referencing "studies" without being able to cite them with specific sources
         - Focus on logical reasoning and industry best practices rather than unsupported metrics
         - When discussing business impact, use qualitative language rather than quantitative claims without data
         - If you must reference statistics, ensure you can provide the specific source, methodology, and context
         - Use phrases like "can lead to", "may result in", "typically provides" instead of definitive percentage claims
         - Ground claims in logical reasoning, established principles, or documented best practices

      8. Code sample guidelines:
        - Ground all code examples in real-world business problems and practical scenarios that developers actually encounter
        - Create standalone code samples that users can copy and run with minimal setup (dependencies are acceptable but should be minimized when possible)
        - Keep code examples as minimal as possible while still clearly illustrating the concept or solution being demonstrated
        - Use realistic business scenarios (e.g., e-commerce, data processing, user management) rather than abstract or toy examples
        - Ensure code samples solve actual problems developers face, not contrived academic exercises
        - Include brief context about the business problem each code sample addresses
        - Provide complete, working examples rather than incomplete snippets when demonstrating key concepts
        - Focus on practical implementations that readers can adapt to their own use cases
        - Prefer using top-level statements for C# code examples instead of traditional class-based structure with Main methods - this makes code samples more concise and modern while maintaining their educational value; only use class-based structure when the example specifically needs to demonstrate class design or when the complexity requires it

      Always: - Focus on reader value and practical applicability - Use
      engaging formatting with headers, lists, and visuals - Test code examples
      and validate technical accuracy - Consider SEO and content marketing best
      practices - Maintain consistency with existing content strategy
